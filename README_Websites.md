## Site 1
* https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/
* Just searched it when it came to mind. Searched it straight from google search
* The design seems a bit current, but still seems the same for a while, just upadted the display areas for new games, info, Sales etc.
* The navigation seems familliar with other sites, a nav bar on the top, sign in/sign up on the top right, the navigation bar drops down to other options when you hover your mouse over the button. It is easy to find things.
* Buttons brighten up when you hover over them, the nav bar drops down, and the game titles lift up a bit when hovered over as well.
* The site is usefull. It is interesting (7.25/10 -IGN). Wouldn't be beautiful, but its up there.
* For what this site is, I don't think it needs to have a BIG change. However, I think they can do better with displaying big titles a bit smaller for more games, info etc. instead of making them so large and trying to use of the negative space.

## Site 2
* https://www.apple.com/ca/
* Was watching Unbox Thereapy and he was having a video about Apple and the new Macbook air, so I decided to search the Apple's website.
* The site seems to be in your face about the new products they have and what they have to offer, seems a bit much from what i see on desktop, even for mobile. I guess it seems timeless the way everyone knows Apple, and how there are massive apple-heads out there that praise this company like its the new bible. 
* The navigation seems familliar again with Playstation, it gives a navigation bar, when clicked on one of the words it loads up a different page with another navigation bar identifying sub-products (Mac-Displayes the newsest one and its features, the other nav bar will show older models). Easy to find things.
* The only thing I see that are interactive is "Learn more" and "Buy" showing an underline when hovered over. The words in the nav bar also get a bit darker.
* The site seems normal from how ive seen it go on over time. It's usefull, interesting? Meh, wouldn't say it's beautiful either, more meh.
* Make. The. Images. Smaller. They're making a big deal of space and then you're scrolling for some time over one product and specs. For someone like me, I'll only go to this site to just quickly look at one thing and just head to the checkout.

## Site 3
* https://www.theweeknd.com/
* Searched it on Google, the thought came to me when I looked at the Weeknd poster I had on my wall. 
* The design of it looks good (IMO), the way that you scroll down, it zooms in on a bunch of pictures and displayes something else WHILE STAYING ON THE HOMEPAGE, and then does it again, and then theres the merch link and social media info, once you get to the bottom. I haven't seen anything like this before, so for me this is very interesting.
* The Nav system is a bit uncommon. Just a bit.
* Easy to find things.
* I can definetly say the site is interactive.
* The site is cool in a way, but I can see it having just a bit more content. I find it very interesting though. THIS I can say is beatiful overall.
* Add more content. the style this site has is nothing what Ive seen before, just if you could add more content for a fan like, or a new person top the site, like me.

## Site 4
* https://www.stickeryou.com/en-ca
* Just searched stickers and clicked the first link. 
* Seems okay overall. Seems current today. The only thing is to drop the damn drop shadows and bevels, that time has passed for me.
* Nav is common, glad the nav bar drops down to more info for each option. Easy to use and find things.
* "Create Now", Theres a slideshow showinmg off different features about the site beside. Of course the dropdown menue from the nav bar.
* I find this site useful, getting stickers for a buisness or for fun (I put stickers on my longboard, waterbottle, HD, and my laptop, just fun having stickers with funny, cool and/or naughty stickers displayed, shows a bit of character IMO). You can even create one as well so theres an idea of having your very own design on a sticker.
* Hae a logo make-over, and get rid of the drop shadows please...it hurts.

## Site 5
* https://play.typeracer.com/
* Just searched in "Type" and clicked the first link.
* Looks horrible. Dated. Ads, bad use of space and type size for what I'm looking at, got bored instantly just by looking at what's in front of me.
* Navigation is horrible, whever i click on on thing I get sent to a different tab, but also have a way back to the homepaage in that new opened tab? Annoying, just trying to explore but have all these tabs open, or im openeing and closing tabs. This is so uncommon to me IMO.
* The nav bar, everything that is listed in orange turns to a darker colour.
* How do I feel? Sick to my stomach, I'm not gonna try and give this site a chance, it's not usefull, it's pointless. It's sort of interesting, but more like a 4/10 level interesting.
* Chaneg the size of the nav bar and the title of what the site is, I was so confused at what I was getting into. Keep things within one tab. the way the site is about, you can make this look so simple and easy to navigate. It also feels like theres too much about this site FOR YOUR TYPING SPEED! Most of the time people are just "Hey, this is my speed of typing, that's it, but this?! Too much detail going into it, I'm sorry. You can just display it in simple boxes of the game, stats, and all the damn info you got, but even that, just have the game set up and view the score after? Idk...just certainly not this.
